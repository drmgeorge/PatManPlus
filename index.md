# PatManPlus

Welcome to the next-generation patient list manager.

This will change the life of every junior doctor in the NHS.

PatManPlus was the brain child of Vishnu V Chandrabalan.

Vishnu is a Senior Registrar in Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary, working at Manchester Royal Infirmary. The software is designed to allow Junior Doctors to manage their patient lists to provide an efficient way to complete a ward round and manage the various jobs assigned to that ward.

In many hospitals there are inefficient methods to control the process utilising several word documents or poorly managed spreadsheets. Vishnu improved this through the use of an Access DB which has had positive impact on the efficiency of Dr's and Consultants within his own working environment. Together we have analysed Visnu's system to produce an MVP that would allow this system be contained within a .exe file that can be run directly from a hospitals network drive. Thus allowing easy transfer of the system from one hospital to another without the requirement of guidance/training from Vishnu.
